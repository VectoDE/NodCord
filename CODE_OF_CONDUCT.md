## Contributor Code of Conduct

### Our Commitment

To foster an open and welcoming environment, the contributors and maintainers pledge to make participation in the project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

### Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Showing respect for differing viewpoints and experiences
- Accepting constructive criticism gracefully
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Showing empathy toward other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information without explicit permission
- Other conduct that could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

### Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the project leads at [tim.hauke@hauknetz.de](mailto:tim.hauke@hauknetz.de) or on Discord (`vecto.`). All complaints will be reviewed and investigated, resulting in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.

### Collaborative Work

NodCord relies on close collaboration between the API, bot, and database teams. Please respect the agreed review processes for TypeScript code, Prisma schemas, and MySQL migrations to ensure consistent results.
